    laws:
      - name: Wages
        limit: 80% exempt - 20% subject to levy
        description: >-
          <p>Colorado exempts 80% of wages. This means that the bankruptcy trustee can take up to 20% of pre-petition wages, even if you were paid the wages after you file. This makes the date of your filing very important to figuring out how this exemption applies.</p>
          <p>If your exempt wages are less than 40 hours of the current minimum wage, you can exempt up to that amount regardless of the 20% rule. So for an easy example, if you make $12.32 per hour (current Colorado minimum wage) and work 40 hours a week, your entire paycheck could be exempt. This gets complicated based on filing dates, lookback periods, and other things, so make sure to get an attorney's help with this.</p>
          <p>Oh yeah, "wages" means money you earn for working. If your income comes from other sources, there may be other (and better) exemptions that apply. Keep reading &hellip;</p>

        description: >-
          <p>Colorado exempts 100% of the debtor's ownership interest in a group life insurance policy. These are the types of policies folks get as a benefit from their employer. They usually aren't worth anything unless the person dies, so this exemption is rarely used. It does cover the proceeds of the policy if it does pay a death benefit though, so beneficiaries don't have to use the insurance money to pay off any debt.</p>

          <p>Colorado allows a full exemption for an insurance contract, including those for annuities, to restrict the rights of anyone other than the policy owner to take the value or benefits of the policy. This is highly specific to the language in the contract and may or may not apply depending on the how the specific policy contract is written.</p>

        description: >-
          <p>Colorado allows an exemption of $250,000 for the cash surrender value of a life insurance policy, but only if the policy has been owned for more than 4 years. This exemption does not cover the amount of the cash value that is a result of contributions to the insurance policy over and above the premium that have been made in the past 4 years.</p>
          <p>In other words, if you've paid only the required premiums, then you're covered if you've owned the policy for 4 years. If you've paid extra into the policy, then you'll need to do some math to figure out how much this exemption will cover.</p>
          <p>This one doesn't make sense to a lot of people, and that's okay. Some people use life insurance as an investment rather than as a way to provide death benefits. If you aren't investing in life insurance, this doesn't apply to you. If you own a whole life, universal life, or other similar policy, figuring this exemption will take some work.</p>
